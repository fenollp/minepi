# minepi
Mine π decimals for human-readable data using your eyes, space-filling curves &amp; statistical analysis.

## Goal
We split areas of π's decimals abusing *placer mining* analogies at a central community website.
Then people use somewhat developer-agnostic visual reverse engineering software like [..cantor.dust..](https://sites.google.com/site/xxcantorxdustxx/) or an in-browser version not unlike [Cortesi's](http://binvis.io/#/).
They look for easily recognisable patterns that denote common files: bitmaps, text and whatnot.
They *claim* their results on the website at everyone's cheerful amazement.

### Mining π??
To help grasp the concept that π decimals, ie. *numbers*, in fact can be a JPEG on a computer:
* A well written & entertaining blog post [What Colour are your bits?](http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23)
* [The Free Speech flag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy)

### Rationale
If π is a [normal number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number), meaning its infinite sequence of decimals contains every sequence of digits possible, then we have an equivalent of the text ouput by [a monkey spending infinite time on a typewriter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). Then, if our approximate theoretical guess is not too bad, it is only a matter of time before someone finds Hamlet in π. And in all the written or filmed versions!
And if π's decimals are not uniformely spread enough, then [other](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champernowne_constant) [computable constants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_constant) are known to be normal numbers…

### Inspiration
[πfs](https://github.com/philipl/pifs)
They did a more thorough, pedagogical & fun explanation than we did here.
We encourage you to go over there and go through the README.

### Visualisation technology
* [..cantor.dust..'s patterns](https://sites.google.com/site/xxcantorxdustxx/visual-re)
* [Visualizing Entropy in Binary Files](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8577401) (..cantor.dust..'s inspiration)
* [Christopher Domas's talk @ Derbycon 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bM3Gut1hIk) (..cantor.dust..'s creator)

### Mining data
* [π to a million places](http://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/collabs/pi/pi6.txt)
* [Chronology of computation of π](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_computation_of_%CF%80)
So… terabytes of data!
